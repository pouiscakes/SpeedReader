# SpeedReader

It is said that the average person reads at a rate of 200 wpm.<br><br>
This speedreader program demonstrates that by flashing words so fast that the reader has to actively keep up, 
the reader's reading speed will increase without losing comprehension significantly. <br><br>
Give it a shot!
